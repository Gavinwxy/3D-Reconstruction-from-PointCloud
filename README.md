# 3D-Reconstruction-from-PointCloud
Noise removal and image fusing on Point Cloud data 

## Issue

- One to N mapping of SIFT point pairs becomes a problem in calculating optimal transformation.

  - Using *Chi Square Distance* to reduce potential mismatch
  - Checking distance ratio between best and second best match
